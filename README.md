This is a list of the resources I found most useful during preparation for N3 (July 2024).

*Giving a complete overview of the available resources is a non-goal, but you can have a look at the [Inspiration](#inspiration) section for places that provide a more complete overview if that's what you're looking for.*

## Study resources

This section lists study resources grouped by [test section](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/guideline/testsections.html).

### Vocabulary & Kanji

- [Learn Japanese! Kanji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-japanese-kanji/id1078107994) - This iPhone App lets you learn Kanji and related vocabulary for each JLPT-level with spaced repetition. It includes vocabulary for both on- and kun-yomi and comes with optional handwriting support. As a nice bonus, it works offline.
- Pen & paper - Sometimes just writing a kanji until it sticks can be helpful. 

### Grammar

- [日本語総まとめ (Nihongo So-Matome)](https://ask-books.com/jp/somatome/) (Grammar) - While this book series provides a good overview of the relevant grammar points (including exercises and sample sentences with English translation), it's often lacking explanations for the grammar points and as in other books, the number of exercises is limited. I found that this can be addressed though by using additional material like [nihongokyoshi-net.com](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/), while using 日本語総まとめ as a summary / study plan.
- [nihongokyoshi-net.com](https://nihongokyoshi-net.com/jlpt-grammars/) - The most complete JLPT grammar overview I am aware of. I found this website more helpful than grammar reference books, as it better aligns with the JLPT level and does not go into usage scenarios above the current level, which can be overkill.
- [Coto Academy](https://cotoacademy.com/jlpt-prep-course-information/) - For working on grammar, I found it useful to join a group lesson class as it provided additional explanation and practice to the 日本語総まとめ book (which was also used in the class along with other material). I found that group lessons worked best for the grammar part.

### Reading

- [日本語総まとめ (Nihongo So-Matome)](https://ask-books.com/jp/somatome/) (Reading Comprehension) - In this book relevant vocabulary and grammar points are introduced before each reading, making the reading itself more accessible.

### Listening

I did not practice listening (as I got enough exposure to listening through staying in Japan) - happy to take suggestions.

## Inspiration

This section lists places where you can get an overview of other available resources.

### Books

#### Online

- [Amazon Japan](https://www.amazon.co.jp/JLPT/s?k=JLPT) - Amazon Japan of course has the biggest sortiment of JLPT books.

#### Physical stores

- [Kinokuniya Shinjuku Main Store](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jg4NpcuciAXBtozb7) - The vast majority of JLPT books are available here to check out. Unfortunately no seats.
- [Tsutaya Books Daikan-yama](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pafgJfy168aNcxmD8) - While the selection of JLPT books is almost matching the one of the Kinokuniya Shinjuku Main Store, this one has seats (Starbucks inside the bookshop).
